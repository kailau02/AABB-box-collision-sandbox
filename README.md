# AABB-box-collision-sandbox
This is a very basic sandbox game using SFML. It includes 2D AABB box collision. Although it is slightly buggy (specifically when building a wall and jumping into it), it was one of my first attempts with physics and collisions in a c++ program with minimal library support. It is a fun program to waste a few minutes so download it and check it out!
